Good morning, Ron!
 
I worked on logs until late last night and got all downloaded and all but 10 processed.  Finished them this morning, so this batch represents all I have minus the ADIF, EXCEL, TEXT, and PAPER logs of which there are perhaps 20 or so to work through.  Now I can work on them immediately as new ones come in.  In this batch:
 
1. K5ZZR and KM4RK resubmitted logs, so I processed them again.
 
2. X02C appeared in several logs.  It's a Canadian special event station and should show location QC, not DX.  I may have incorrectly  "corrected" it to DX in some previous logs (including at least one in this batch).  I didn't go back to find those logs, so you might code a check into your program like you did for VE9AA.
 
3. W0F.K0VBU turned in two logs named W0F.K0VBU.JOH and W0F.K0VBU.MIA.  He operated Multi-Op with a Scout group portable from MIA one day, and Single-Op at home the other day.  Put both of them in the final results.
 
Other comments:
 
KS0KS apparently had one other operator log which I never got.  Kent shows it as KS0KS/KB0ISQ in the Logs Received.  I've contacted Kent to resend it to me if it exists.  I've gotten several emails from KS0KS with two log files from N0TMC and AD0KN with no mention of a third log, so we'll continue to do some sleuthing and keep you posted.  What would the world be like without a KS0KS controversy? :-)
 
Next steps.
 
1. I'll compare Kent's Logs Received list with the logs I have to see what we're missing.
2. I'll contact all the 1x1 stations who have yet to turn in a log and see if we can coax one out of them.
 
Time to go to work!  It's the start of muzzleloader and archery season today.  My pickup is in the shop, so until it comes back, I won't hunting since it would be hard to transport a deer.  I worked on my tree stand for awhile yesterday.  We had a big flood there, but no damage, so I just did some tree trimming with the pole saw.  I've had at least three really nice bucks caught on tree cam and saw one of them yesterday during a walk with Lorna and Roxxy, so it should be an interesting year.

PS I'll start working on the TQP now, too!
